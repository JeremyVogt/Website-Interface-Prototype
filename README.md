# S.W.A.N. Learning Prototype
This was a project created by myself and Riker Greenslade for our Human-Computer Interaction 1 class in Fall 2013 at the University of Manitoba.

This is a high-fidelity prototype of a web-based course management system called "S.W.A.N. Learning". A high-fidelity prototype is a non-functional mockup of a website or application that a user can interact with to test its interaction flow. However, the functionality of the website (i.e. the back end) is not yet implemented.
